# <Module-1-Challenge>

## Description

The motivation of the project was to add proper tagging and make the code more clear within the index refactor.html without changing the actual layout or styling of the website.
 I wanted to show how to use proper tagging and elements within the html, as well as showing how you can compile class elements in your html to simplify the css coding. Throughout the project, I found a multitude of tags lacking within the html as well as a lot of code within the .css that could be combined to simplify the coding. There were a number of tags that were just div=class instead of the actual tags, like header and footer, as well as parts that did not have the actual tags at all, like main and article. The biggest thing I learned what the difference between a regular image in html and a background image in css. I had tried to add the image that was within the css to html and tried multiple times to format the image but it would only work in the css as background-image. I learned how to compile things within the css by combining the classes in the html so it can simplify the code. Another thing that i had learned is how adding different tags like <section> can completely change the layout of the website and i needed to find the right tag that would not change the layout.
