# <Module-1-Challenge>

# User Story 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Description
* The goal was to debug the page given to add the proper tagging and layout to the HTML and CSS.
* Multiple tags were not named properly and some aspects did not work like a link being clicked in the index.html file and had to be changed.
* Parts of the CSS were not written properly and was changed.
* The code has been corrected and is more legible than prior. 
* The actual functionality of the page did not change after the debugging and still functioned properly. 

# Technologies 
* HTML
* CSS
